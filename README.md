# echo

A Delta Chat echo bot in multiple languages to get you started.
The bot just echos back any text message you send to it.

### High-level bot frameworks (recommended)

The easiest and fastest way of creating bots is using high-level
bot frameworks that provide a lot of the repetitive boilerplate
and functionality most bots need and let you focus on the new
bot logic.


| Language                                     | core version |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [deltabot-cli Go](./go_deltabot_cli)         | `2.14.0`     |
| [deltabot-cli Python](./python_deltabot_cli) | `2.14.0`     |
|                                              |              |

### Low-level libraries (advanced)

Most of the time the high-level bot frameworks are what you want,
but if you need more fine-control and flexibility you can use the
following low-level libraries:

| Language                          | core version |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| [C](./c)                          | `1.132.1`    |
| [Go](./go)                        | `1.127.0`    |
| [Node.js](./nodejs_stdio_jsonrpc) | `1.139.3`    |
| [Deno](./deno)                    | `1.152.1`    |
| [Python](./python)                | `1.132.1`    |
| [Rust](./rust)                    | `1.132.1`    |
